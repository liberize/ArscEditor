### ArscEditor

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/seaase/ArscEditor/blob/master/LICENSE)

It is a tool for editing android's arsc file.This tool is written in Java.You can use it to edit strings and the arsc's package name, etc.

Now it's opened to public.I hope the friends around the world could make contribution for Open Source together.

It is NOT intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing, adding some features or support for custom platforms and other GOOD purposes. Just try to be fair with authors of an app, that you use and probably like.
